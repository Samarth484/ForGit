this one's great!
It says:

To start...
is an art...
and after all...
Start, is also a part!

So be smart...
don't think much, just "Start!"
Put your soul, mind and heart...
practise harder and even hard, 
discard all the leisures apart...
Sooner or later, you'll surely hit the centre:
whilst you throw your dart!🚩🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇
